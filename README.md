## Football Data Application with Oracle, SQL, Java and PHP

Developed a soccer information application using Oracle as the relational database. Implemented functionalities like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for teams, players, and other entities, along with queries using joins, aggregations, and nesting for complex data retrieval. Handled data manipulation with SQL, and built the backend and user interface (UI) using Java and PHP. This project demonstrates expertise in Oracle database management, SQL querying, and PHP web development.

The application has the following capabilities:

* Insert - Add a team in our database.
* Delete - Delete a team from our database
* Update - Change the name of the team you want from our database.
* Select - Show all the players of each Nationality
* Project - Project the different attributes of a match
* Join - Show Players by Position
* Aggregate with group by - Show number of goals by each scorer
* Aggregate with having - Show total number of each nationality's goals, but just for those with more than one goal in total.
* Nested aggregation with group by - Show the topscorers of the league you want from our database
* Division - Show the players or workers from teams with no scored goals


Note: The DatabaseNo file is just used to initialize the database at the beginning to avoid overwritting the data.
